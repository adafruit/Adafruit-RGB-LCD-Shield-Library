This new Adafruit shield makes it easy to use a 16x2 Character LCD. We really like the range of LCDs we stock in the shop, such as our classic <a href="http://www.adafruit.com/products/181">blue & white</a> as well as the fancy <a href="http://www.adafruit.com/products/399">RGB negative</a> and <a href="http://www.adafruit.com/products/398">RGB positive</a>. Unfortunately, these LCDs do require quite a few digital pins, 6 to control the LCD and then perhaps another 3 to control the RGB backlight for a total of 9 pins. That's half of the pins available on a classic Arduino! 

With this in mind, we wanted to make it easier for people to get these LCD into their projects so we devised a shield that lets you control <b>a 16x2 Character LCD, up to 3 backlight pins AND 5 keypad pins using only the two I2C pins on the Arduino!</b> The best part is you don't really lose those two pins either, since you can stick i2c-based sensors, RTCs, etc and have them share the I2C bus. This is a super slick way to add a display without all the wiring hassle.
